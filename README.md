# sample_rails_api

Sample pure API made on rails

## Using the API

### Postman
I have tested this app using Postman. Included in this repository is `test_payloads.postman_collection.json`, a postman collection of the two payloads provided in the spec.

### RSpec
I have used RSpec for unit testing on this. To see the test results, you can run `rspec` at the root directory.
